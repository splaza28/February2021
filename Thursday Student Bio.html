 <p>I am a Safety Specialist at NJ Motor Vehicle Commission. I work in the driver testing sector with new and existing drivers looking to attain Auto or Commercial drivers licenses. I am a mother of one and a half boys. The second half is baking as I am 8 months pregnant! My first son, Oliver, will be 2 on the first day of bootcamp.
    I am of Puerto Rican descent. I lived in Puerto Rico for a few years as child, but was born and raised in Trenton, NJ.
    I enjoy traveling and exploring new places, trying out new restaurants, visiting the beach, and spending time with my son and family.
    My dream job is one that will offer me the flexibility to enjoy my children as much as possible while financially allowing me to build and secure their future.
    I currently reside in Hamilton, NJ. My fiance and I purchased a home in the area about a year and a half ago.
    I want to be a web developer because I want to challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone and learn something new that can potentially add great value to my marketability. It is the perfect opportunity for a career change!
